# Todo List App  

This project is a simple Todo List application built with React and Vite. This app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.  

## Technologies  

- **React**: For building the user interface.  
- **Vite**: For faster development builds.  
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern styling.  

## Installation  

To get started with the project, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the repository**:  

   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/IldizovNodirbek/TODO-LIST-with-REDUX.git  
   cd todo-list-app
   npm install
   npm run dev

   
### Key Improvements:  
- **Consistent Use of Code Blocks**: I added code blocks around the commands for better formatting.  
- **Bullet Points for Project Structure**: I formatted the project structure as a bulleted list for easier readability.  
- **Formatting of Steps**: Each step in the installation and usage sections has been properly formatted and listed with a leading number followed by a period and a space for better clarity.  
- **Hyperlink for Localhost**: The URL for localhost is now clickable.
